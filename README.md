# Pre-Work Study Guide

## Description

This is a test project used for teaching basics in HTML/CSS/JavaScript. 
This project has helped me learn workflow- branching, readme's and SSH keys are all areas of limited knowledge for me so I am quite glad they are making such a prominent place in this project. I will be keeping this readme as a boilerplate for future projects as I think it will be useful.
